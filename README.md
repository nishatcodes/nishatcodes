    👋 Hi, My name is Nishat, and I currently attend Simon Fraser University.
    👀 I’m interested in AI, specifically AI Vision, NLP, and even Audio related AI inputs. I love to explore 
      the ways in which technology can be utilized to solve real-world problems and make our lives easier.
    🌱 I’m currently learning advanced concepts in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning 
       to sharpen my skills and keep myself updated with the latest technologies.
    💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects related to AI that involve working with a team to
       build innovative solutions. I believe that collaborating with diverse and talented individuals 
       can lead to breakthroughs and growth both individually and as a team.
